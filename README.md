# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting cancellations of hotel bookings. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify patterns and factors that contribute to booking cancellations. This can help hotels manage reservations more effectively and reduce the impact of cancellations.

## Data Description
The data set used in this project includes various features related to hotel bookings, such as lead time, arrival date, number of guests, booking changes, previous cancellations, and others. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical data into a format suitable for modeling.

## Methodology
The project employs several machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The performance of these models is evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also employ techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.

## Installation and Running the Code
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/quocanhphan/DA_HotelBookingCancellationPrediction>
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Hotel_Booking_Analysis_Predicting_Cancellation.ipynb
   ```
